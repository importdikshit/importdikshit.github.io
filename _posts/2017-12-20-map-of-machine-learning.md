title: A MAP of Machine Learning
---

*No, this is not an article about Maximum A-Posteriori Estimation.* This is a cleaned up version of some research that I was doing for myself following a very chaotic Fall Semester. I am currently at a point where I want to start narrowing down the areas of Machine Learning that I am going to establish as my research stronghold. However, I do not want to dive into a sub-area without knowing of the other potential opportunities which are currently just slightly out of my line of sight. Therefore, I have compiled - *what I believe to be* - an exhaustive list of areas and sub-areas within Machine Learning, with corresponding explanations of what they encompass. Within this article, I examine nook and cranny of some sub-topics within most sub-areas of Artificial Intelligence which currently host active *(and public)* research.

I was inspired to write this guide by [this brilliant video]("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmJ-4B-mS-Y") which presents a 10,000 ft overview of Mathematics. It is a video that helped me navigate the Mathematical jargon which was spewed at me anytime I asked someone in Evans Hall what their area of research is. I hope that this guide will help those of you who are intimidated by sentences like **"Convolutional Sequence to Sequence learning."** or **"Optimizer generation using TRPO based Reinforcement Learning methods"** to find some footing within the field. Alternatively, I hope this article can guide those of you keen on foraying into the realm of Artificial Intelligence make some informed decisions early into the long academic path that lies ahead.

NOTE 1: This article assumes a passable Mathematical background. As long as you can differentiate between optimization talk and probability talk you should be good to go. Any place in which I am assume some prerequisites - I will provide a link to an article that I feel best summarizes the concept at hand.

NOTE 2: This article is incredibly malleable. I have inevitably eclipsed some details. I have also probably omitted some incredibly cool areas of research. If you would like to help me patch this up - send me an email at ishan.d@berkeley.edu and we can include your bit within this article (with credits of course). Please think twice before flaming me - remember - writing this was a bit of a learning curve for me.
