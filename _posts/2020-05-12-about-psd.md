this website is an attempt to improve my writing and exposition skills. i aim to do this by sharing my thoughts on the things that i am learning and some techincal notes on the things that (i believe) i have already know. 

i named the website positively semi-definite for two reasons:

-> **a reduction to familiarity**: a positively semi-definite matrix (in $$\mathbf{R}$$) is one which has eigenvalues $$\lambda_i \geq 0$$. while examining an algorithm/system, proving that a matrix is positively semidefinite (PSD) generally gives an immediate piercing insight into the way things will probably behave. i believe that this is a fundamental goal of every technical note: cutting through the noise to reduce complicated thoughts into a bunch of familiar concepts which give any reader an intuition about the way things *really* are.

-> **an expression of uncertainty**: to be semi-definite about something is to be uncertain. this one works on two levels. most of my technical notes will deal with statisitcs - the science of uncertainty. additionally, i am fundamentally uncertain about a lot of things: my 'unknown unknowns'. i will only publish opinions that i am reasonably confident about - but there will always be some uncertainty inherent to this process. i hope that this website will educate me about the things i am fundamentally oblivious to, by subjecting my understanding of things to a very public 'peer review' process.
