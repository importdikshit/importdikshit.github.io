##  My Goals for this Project

A running list of my goals for this blog. This is in descending order of personal importance.

1. **To explain things in a clearer manner**. I often catch myself opting for technical rigor and being nitpicky where it serves to be absolutely counterproductive. I want to be able to communicate ideas to wider audiences in a simpler manner: both in terms of avoiding unnecessary nuance and maintaining intuitiveness.

2. **Surmounting False Perfectionism.** This is a very real issue in my everyday life: analysis paralysis. I obsess over covering EVERY edge case, making it VERY well rounded and chasing some PYRRHIC standard of shipment.
My aim is to remain FACTUALLY CORRECT - but only *almost satisfied* - with the content that I push out.

3. **Improving my writing skills.** This seems slightly oxymoronic when read immediately after the previous sentence. However, the goal is to be able to write clearer - much quicker. I want to improve the quality of my output by increasing the frequency of my output.

4. **Explore more interesting ideas in a "hands on manner".**  As a mathematician in training this is the most valuable skill that I am - *still* - trying to inculcate. Being half baked on my theory and well exposed to practice problems has always served me better than hammering the theory down perfectly with little exposure to the practical side. The Land of Theory is basically an unconstrained optimization problem. I want to learn Machine Learning by doing and communicating.

5. |**Regularity in purpose.** I want to build up some impetus to keep exploring new ideas within Machine Learning. It is fairly easy for me - in particular - to get drawn into some sense of comfort with a regular agenda. I want to push myself to explore new concepts and new ideas on a recurring basis.

6. **Outreach.** Using this as an opportunity to meet new people working on similar, interesting concepts.

7. **To contribute to the community.** The number of new concepts I have learned about because I decided to explore an intriguingly worded title on HackerNews is pretty large. My aim is to produce content on similar lines.  


## About Me:


[A picture of me](https://github.com/importdikshit/importdikshit.github.io/blob/master/_assets/about/IMG_0126.jpg)

I am a Rising Senior pursuing degrees in Mathematics and Statistics (and a Minor in Computer Science) at Berkeley. I am very passionate about Theoretical Machine Learning - and am currently shopping around for a definite subfield to really "dig my teeth into".

When I am not trying to catch up on problem sets that I have been procrastinating on, I like to play golf, go hiking, and eat lots of good food (mostly the last one). I also like to take advantage of the unconventional opportunities for fun that the bay area has to offer. Within the last month itself I flew an airplane and went axe throwing - things I am sure I would not have been able to do if I did not live here.
