# My Goals for this Project

A running list of my goals for this blog. This is in descending order of personal importance.

1. To explain things in a clearer manner. I often catch myself opting for nuance and being technically nitpicky where it serves to be absolutely counterproductive. I want to be able to communicate ideas to wider audiences in a simpler manner: both in terms of avoiding unnecessary nuance and maintaining intuitiveness.

2. Surmounting False Perfectionism. Yes, perfectionism is an issue in my daily - Ship before you start micro obsessing.

4. Explore more interesting ideas in a hands on manner.
5. Outreach
6. Regularity in purpose.I want to explore new topics within Machine Learning. By sharing fresh ideas in a more informed manner, I will have the opportunity explore tangents which I would not have otherwise paid much attention to. Although I am comfortable using Normal Distributions and the Law of Large Numbers in an academic/research context, I have not done a depth-first-search of them with the resolution that I would like. I would love to run some simulations to observe the Law of Large numbers in practice, examine the gaussian in an information-theoretic context, etc.

7. Community.I want to contribute to the community. A little content goes a really long way. The number of new concepts I have learned about because I decided to explore an intriguingly worded title on HackerNews or the Machine Learning subreddit is pretty large. By sharing the things that I would have liked to see an article on when I was starting off with Machine Learning, I will be able to contribute to a community that has taught me a very significant amount. Articles which talk someone through how to deploy a scraper, what sort of databases are recommended for collecting which sorts of data, how to productionize a trained Machine Learning model would have been of great utility to me a few months ago!
8. Improve your writing skills.  


# About Me:

I am a Rising Senior pursuing degrees in Mathematics and Statistics (and a Minor in Computer Science) at Berkeley. I am very passionate about Theoretical Machine Learning - and am currently shopping around for a subfield within which I would like to delve deep.

When I am not trying to catch up on problem sets that I have been procrastinating on, I like to play golf, go hiking, and eat lots of good food (mostly the last one). I also like to take advantage of the unconventional opportunities for fun that the bay area has to offer. Within the last month itself I flew an airplane and went axe throwing - things I am sure I would not have been able to do if I did not live here.

If you like my content, if you have spotted an error, or if you would simply like to collaborate on some content - feel free to reach out at ishan.d@berkeley.edu. I will try my best to respond within some reasonable timeline!
