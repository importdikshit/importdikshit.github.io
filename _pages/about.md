Hi, my name is Ishan. I am a Rising Senior at UC Berkeley. I like the Machine Learning Stack - especially the theoretical side of things. I have taken some interesting classes at Berkeley - ranging from Abstract Algebra to Machine Learning.

[Here](https://importdikshit.github.io) is a (probably outdated) version of my resume.

If you like/love my content, or if you have spotted an error, or if you would like to collaborate on something - feel free to reach out to me. Email is in the header of the resume.
