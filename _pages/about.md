> about me: 

hi, my name is Ishan. i enjoy decomposing complex narratives into simple hypotheses which can be examined with data. i've previously done machine learning research at three different labs in Berkeley and was the professional chair of the mathematics undergraduate students association. i'm currently doing data science/quantitative research (pick your preferred buzzword) at BlackRock in New York.
